## Self-Correction
The Generic self-correction prompt was implemented in a zero-shot setting, where all queries were
assumed to be "Buggy SQL".

The Gentle self-correction prompt was implemented in a zero-shot setting. For this self-correction prompt
we donâ€™t have the assumption of being Buggy and we included some instructions for fixing the SQL
queries.
